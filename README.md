# HuntTheWumpus
Hunt the Wumpus in every language I like 



Personal project the branches out from 'Lanaguage Paradigms' class I did at university. Every set of code must follow the same rules: 

CURRENT COMPLETED LANGUAGES: 
- Fortran: The hardest as fortran documentation is complex
- Literate C: Interesting use of documentation at the same time as coding
- Prolog: Documentation is hard to find but fun once you understand it
- Lisp: Documentation is interesting to understand

CURRENT INCOMPLETE LANGUAGES: 
- Python: To see how fast it will go 
- C#: Writing this in unity to see if I can create a cool visual 


- 12 rooms in total
- Each room has 3 tunnels to other rooms
- You can only move to one room at a time

HAZARDS
- 2 sets of Bats that send you to another room at random
- 2 Pits that end the game
- 1 Wumpus that you must shoot with an arrow from a connecting room. 
    > You can scare the wumpus by moving in the next room and it can run into your current room and eat you
    
WINNING STATE
- You shoot the wumpus from another room 

TOOLS
- When entering a room you may be given an instruction about a connecting room but not which one: 
  > BATS : 'screech'
  > PIT : 'Wind sounds'
  > WUMPUS: 'You can smell him'
  
- You have a set of crooked arrows. You shoot in one tunnel and they travel for three. It is possible for the arrows to come around in a circle and shoot you. 
  This will kill you.
